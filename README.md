# Gradle Testing Plugin

Gradle has some fantatic documentation around how to test an authored plugin. It explains and then demonstrates how to fulfil the testing pyramid. Please see here: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/testing_gradle_plugins.html

Creating a test suites for `functionalTests` and `integrationTests` every time you author a new plugin is a bit annoying. I thought I would make a plugin to make it less repetitive.
